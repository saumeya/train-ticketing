# Train Ticketing System

This project is a simple train ticket booking system built using Go. It allows users to book train tickets by communicating with a gRPC-based server.

## Features

- **Ticket Booking**: Users can book tickets for a train route from a predefined list of route.
- **gRPC Communication**: The client and server communicate using gRPC, providing a robust and scalable way to handle ticket booking requests.
- **Show Receipt**: User can see the receipt of their booked ticket.
- **Modify ticket**: User can request to modify the seat allotted to them.
- **Remove Ticket**: Use can request to cancel the ticket.
- **View Ticket by train Section**: User can view the allotted seats of a train by section and username.
- **Concurrency Control**: The system can enable concurrency that allows only one user to book a ticket at a time.


## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

- Go
- Git

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saumeya/train-ticketing.git
   cd train-ticketing
2. **Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   go run server/main.go
3. **Run the Client on a different Terminal**:
   ```bash
   go run client/main.go
   
## Assumptions

- **Single Ticket Booking**: The User can book only one ticket at a time.
- **Predefined Train Routes**: The system uses a predefined list of train routes stored in a mock database. The routes are initialized in the code, and users can only book tickets for these routes.
- **Seat Allotment Process**: Seat Allotment is sequentially implemented, the next available seat is given to the user starting from Section A to Section B
- **Email as Username**:Each user is identified by a unique email address, which serves as their username for all train seat operations.
- **Train Seats and Sections**: Each train is divided into two sections, A and B, with 20 seats available in each section.

### Components

- **Server**: Handles incoming ticket booking requests from clients and processes them. It includes separation between booking services and train operations.
- **Client**: Sends ticket booking requests to the server and displays the server's response.
- **API**: Contains the protobuf (proto) definitions and structs used for gRPC communication. This includes message types, service definitions, and RPC methods.
  
## Future Scope

- **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication to allow multiple users to securely book tickets. Add login/signup options.
- **Database Integration**: Replace the mock database with a real database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) to store user information and ticket bookings persistently.
- **Multiple Ticket Booking**: Allow users to book multiple tickets in a single transaction, improving flexibility and user experience.
- **Improved Seat Allotement**: Develop a better algorithm for seat allocation that considers user preferences and introduces randomization to optimize seat assignments.
